# (Spanish) Pseudocode syntax lexer for Pygments

This package contains a Pygments Lexer for some basic pseudocode algorithmics.

## Installation

The lexer is available as a Pip package:

    pip install pygments-lexer-pseudocode

Alternatively, to install from the git repository: (you may need to sudo depending on your Python environment)

    python setup.py install

## Usage

After installation the Pseudocode lexer automatically registers itself for files with the `.algo` and `.pseudocode` extensions. Therefore, usage is easy:
